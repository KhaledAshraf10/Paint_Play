# 🎨 OOP Paint Play Application in C++

## 📋 Project Overview
Paint Play is an interactive desktop drawing application developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++. It combines the simplicity of a paint tool with the logic of a puzzle game, allowing users to draw, manipulate shapes, and save their artwork. This project demonstrates the application of design patterns, class hierarchies, and file handling in a real-world desktop app.
